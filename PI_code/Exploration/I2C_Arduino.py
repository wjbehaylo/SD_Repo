# Purpose: this is an exploration file to set up the Raspberry Pi to Arduino I2C sending.

# Relevant files: this file is related to the I2C_Pi file located in ARD_code.
# Circuitry: if the code is run using some type of wiring or external circuit, there should be a description of how to wire up that circuit, such that someone can recreate the full test.from smbus2 import SMBus
