# Purpose: this is a demonstrable file that has the currently up to data code on the FSM contained within it
# Contributors: Walter, Angela
# Sources: 
#   Based on programming used in SEED_LAB for python state machine
# Relevant files: 
#   UART_Comms.py contains the code for the UART system
#   CameraCalibAndShapeDetection.py contains the code used for the computer vision
#   VL53L0X-sensor-code.py contains the code that indicates how the VL53L0X time of flight sensor works
#   FSM_Outline contains the relevant states that are being used
# Circuitry: 
#   for the Pi, follow the circuitry outline in UART_Comms, VL53L0X-sensor-code, CameraCalibAndShapeDetection, and I2C_Arduino (exploration file)
