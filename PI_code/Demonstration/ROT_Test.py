# Purpose: just to test the functinoality of the rotational arduino communications, without needing to mess with the FSM
# Contributors: Walter, Angela
# Sources: 
#   Based on programming used in SEED_LAB for python state machine
#   ARD_Comms has the functions we need to send and receive from the arduino
#   Generate_Status prints out vectors from integer status codes being used
#   UART_Comms.py has the threaded functionality that lets the system communicate with UART
# Relevant files: 
#   UART_Comms.py contains the code for the UART system
#   ARD_Comms has the functions we need to send and receive from the arduino
#   Generate_Status prints out vectors from integer status codes being used
#   Rot_Comms.ino contains the Arduino code that will be running
# Circuitry: 
#   for the Pi, follow the circuitry outline in UART_Comms, and I2C_Arduino (exploration file)
#   For the Arduino, wire it to the pins and stuff as outlined in Rot_Comms.ino
